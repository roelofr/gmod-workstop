## Supported Versions

Normally, only the most recent version is supported. This is also
the version that's published on the [Steam Workshop][1].

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.3.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 1.2.x   | :x:                |

| < 1.1   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you found a loophole, please make an issue. Since the application is fairly
sandboxed, it's usually not required to send an e-mail concerning the
vulnerability.

If you found a vulnerability in the Garry's Mod core, please report it to
Facepunch Studios.

If you _really_ want to send an e-mail, you can send it to github@roelof.io,
mentioning "Workstop" in the subject.
